# Statistics-for-Data-Analysis


The workshop provides an opportunity to pursue a more advanced area of analytics. Today organisations and businesses collect and store information in data warehouses, and such information is available to be 'mined' for improved management decision making. Some of that information can be analysed with simple statistics, but much of it requires more complex, multivariate statistical techniques. The module thus focuses on the use of a range of applied multivariate data analysis techniques to convert information into knowledge.

* Develop a comprehensive understanding of the different categories of multivariate modelling, and how they are inter-related.
* Apply several multivariate statistical models to real data sets, conducting a range of analyses using appropriate software.
* Produce reports investigating real data sets and be able to report on the findings from a piece of modelling and analysis in practical terms.
* Demonstrate a sound knowledge of the relevant issues and measures available to aid selection of the most suitable models.
